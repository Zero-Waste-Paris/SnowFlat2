Fork of the theme SnowFlat of q2a (which can be found at https://github.com/q2a/question2answer/tree/dev/qa-theme/SnowFlat )

It changes in particular:
- the look & feel
- html meta in the header related to facebook open graph and twitter cards

I'm afraid I'm not really aware of the other changes that were made...

(This repo isn't a github fork because the original SnowFlat them isn't a standalone repo: it is bundled with question2answer).

I'm afraid the changes weren't made with reuse in mind so some of those changes are pretty specific to mesquestionszerodechet.fr
(for instance the fb:app_id, the reference to a logo file) so it may not be trivial to re-use for another site... :-/

As far as license is concerned: most of this repo is probably GPL v2 (or any later version) since it is based on a code
which is itself GPL v2 (see https://github.com/q2a/question2answer/blob/dev/LICENSE.html )
